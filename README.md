# About My Cartoons App
## Background
Having a nice application where one can store favorite shows is critical. This is especially so when it comes to parents with children who need close attention regarding what they watch and how they get content online. My Cartoons App has been created to bring together favorite local cartoons that are educative, entertaining and adventurous for the children. The focus is to help parents collect cartoons that are relevant to their children's needs and access them with relative ease. 

## Development
The project has been developed primarily with React-JS. Through the npx create-react-app command to generate all the necessary files and dependencies. The clean-up process precedes the creation of the relevant components and codes for the project. The project uses a developer-produced API of the cartoons in a db-json file that is then uploaded to typicode server for public access. Currently, the APP has been deployed to Heroku and publicly accessible through the live link shared in this READme. 

## App Description 
The primary purpose of the APP is to collect cartoons that are relevant and important to selected audience. As a first development stage, the App offers provisions for one to view the description of the cartoon, its recommended age as well as a link to watch the Youtube video of the specific cartoon. Future devevelopmets could focus on having a submission page where users can submit their cartoons and update the database, and a search bar for users to search their cartoons.
