  <p>I am a junior Software Developer. My committment to learning pushed me to enroll into a software engineering course at Moringa and I appreciate the skills and the development that the institution offers.</p>
  <p>
<strong>What brings me to where I am todayâ€¦</strong>

Among a plethora of services, web design and development, tailor made applications, ERPs, CRMs, e-commerce solutions, business-to-business applications, business-to-client applications, managed hosting and internet portal management are few that we offer. Satisfied clients around the globe will bear testimony to the quality of our work.
