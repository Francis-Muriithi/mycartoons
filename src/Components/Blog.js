        <h5> Each day of your life, as soon as you open your eyes in the morning, you can square away for a happy and successful day. It’s the mood and the purpose of the inception of each day that are the important facts in charting your course for the day. We can always square away for a fresh start, no matter what the past has been. It’s today that is the paramount problem always. Yesterday is but history.</h5>
